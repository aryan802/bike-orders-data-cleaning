Data Cleaning Process â€“ Bike Sales Dataset

This document explains how we cleaned and prepared the Bike Sales dataset, which originally consisted of three raw CSV files:

orders.csv â€“ contains order details

customers.csv â€“ contains customer details

products.csv â€“ contains product/bike details

The cleaned dataset will be used for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and further insights.
